Welcome to my new homepage where I will blog a lot more than I did on
my old page, I promise.

My blog posts will be about computers, programming, software, computer
graphics and to some extent life in general :)

My first tip is the software that has actually created this page:
<a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org" rel="external">nanoc</a>.

nanoc (yes, it must be written with the first letter lower case) is a
static site compiler. It works much like a compiler for a traditional
programming - you give it a file of rules and it compiles your source
code into a result.

But now, why would you want a static site in the 21st
century?

The answer is efficiency. Since what you see here is only static
pages, there is no code executed on the web server. This also gives
better security - try to hack a static page ;). It also gives you more
control since you have all the code for your web page, your articles
are not laying around in some database at some third party web host.

nanoc is also very flexible and can be extended in a number of ways.
For dynamic content, javascript can be used. I use Disqus for the
ability to have comments and it is really nice!
So, for a small to medium sized website it can be very suitable.

Other static site generators are for example 
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com" rel="external">Jekyll</a> (written in Ruby
as nanoc) and <a href="http://ringce.com/hyde" rel="external">Hyde (written in Python).
