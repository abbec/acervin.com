Phyano is a VST implementation of digital waveguides attempting to
simulate the sound of the piano. Due to the very complex nature of the
piano, we did not actually get a result that sounds like a piano.

It is however easy to extend the model to include a better model for
the piano soundboard. The model already contains an accurate model for
the piano hammer.
