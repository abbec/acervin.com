This is a simple deferred renderer I developed to try out the
technique to be able to use it in the [game engine](/portfolio/engine "game engine"). It is also a
project in the course "Advanced Computer Graphics Programming". The
renderer supports .obj models (with related .mtl files) and Phong's shading model is
implemented.

The renderer is implemented in DirectX 10.
