Tankenöten was developed in a university course called "Communication
and User Interfaces". It is designed for small children that are
learning to read and at the same time answers questions. It is
designed in a way to be comforting to small children.

Tankenöten is written in Java with the Swing framework.

This was the first larger software that I wrote.
