Blockz is a 2D game developed in the university course "Agile
Usability Development for Handheld Devices". It is loosely based on
the old SNES game _Goof Troop_. 

The course is a way to use agile development processes in a real
project. 

The game is all written in Java with the Android SDK. We are actually
hoping to finish the game to the extent that it can be released on
Android market.
