CAPS is a project carried out in the course "Graphic Design and
Communication". We were to develop a communication platform for a
product and we chose to build around CAPS. CAPS is an imaginary
product used at the grocery store. It scans bar codes and tells the
customer if the contents are safe according to predefined variables
such as allergies or other preferences.

We developed a graphic profile for CAPS along with a folder for market
communication.
